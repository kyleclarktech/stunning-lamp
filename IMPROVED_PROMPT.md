# Improved Assessment Prompt

## Original Prompt
"Comprehensively review and assess the graph and query generation system to ensure it provides a comprehensive framework to address all of the queries that could be involved in complex project and task management across teams."

## Improved Prompt for Global SaaS Context

"Evaluate the graph database system's capability to support a global SaaS data analytics company operating 24/7 across 7 offices (US, UK, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia). The assessment must verify the system can handle:

1. **Cross-timezone resource management** - Finding available experts considering time zones, languages, visa status, and regional holidays
2. **Global project coordination** - Managing customer implementations, platform deployments, and follow-the-sun support models
3. **Regional compliance tracking** - GDPR, CCPA, and data residency requirements by jurisdiction
4. **SaaS operational queries** - Platform reliability coverage, incident response teams, and customer success metrics by region
5. **Scalability for growth** - Supporting 10,000+ employees and 1,000+ enterprise customers

Deliver a gap analysis identifying missing entities (Office, Language, Compliance), test 50+ representative queries, benchmark performance across distributed data, and provide an enhancement roadmap. Success criteria: 95% query coverage, sub-second responses, and full support for multi-region operations."

## Key Improvements

1. **Specific Context**: Clearly identifies the global SaaS data analytics company scenario
2. **Geographic Scope**: Explicitly lists the 7 office locations
3. **Business Requirements**: Focuses on 24/7 operations and SaaS-specific needs
4. **Measurable Outcomes**: Defines concrete deliverables and success metrics
5. **Prioritized Focus Areas**: Breaks down into 5 clear assessment categories
6. **Actionable Results**: Specifies gap analysis, query tests, and roadmap as outputs
