# Enterprise Knowledge Graph & PM Assistant - Complete System Summary

## System Overview

This is a **dual-purpose platform** that combines:
1. **Enterprise Knowledge Graph** - Find people, policies, and processes through natural language
2. **Agentic PM Assistant** - Autonomous project management for teams without dedicated PMs

The system leverages the organizational knowledge graph to make intelligent PM decisions, creating a unified platform for organizational intelligence and project execution.

## Core Components Preserved & Enhanced

### Original Knowledge Graph Features (✓ Preserved)
- **Graph Query Engine** (`@graph-engine`) - Natural language to Cypher queries
- **Schema Registry** (`@schema-registry`) - Entity and relationship definitions  
- **Context Manager** (`@context-manager`) - Lazy loading for performance
- **Query Executor** (`@query-executor`) - Database operations
- **Response Orchestrator** (`@response-orchestrator`) - Result formatting

### New PM Components (➕ Added)
- **Project Planner** (`@project-planner`) - Break down projects into tasks
- **Task Manager** (`@task-manager`) - Task lifecycle and dependencies
- **Skill Matcher** (`@skill-matcher`) - Match tasks with people
- **Bandwidth Tracker** (`@bandwidth-tracker`) - Availability and workload
- **Progress Monitor** (`@progress-monitor`) - Track progress and bottlenecks

## Enhanced Data Model

### Original Entities (✓ Preserved)
- **Person** - Employees with skills, roles, departments
- **Team** - Organizational units
- **Policy** - Compliance and operational policies
- **Group** - Cross-functional groups

### PM Entities (➕ Added)
- **Project** - High-level initiatives with timelines
- **Task** - Actionable work items with dependencies
- **Assignment** - Task-person mappings with confidence scores
- **SkillProfile** - Detailed skill and experience tracking
- **BandwidthRecord** - Availability and commitment tracking

## Integrated Capabilities

### 1. Context-Aware Project Planning
```
User: "Plan a payment integration project"
System: Uses knowledge graph to find payment experts, relevant policies, 
        and past project patterns to create an intelligent project plan
```

### 2. Policy-Compliant Task Assignment
```
User: "Assign the customer data migration task"
System: Checks data policies, finds GDPR-certified team members,
        ensures compliance before making assignments
```

### 3. Skill-Based Resource Discovery
```
User: "Who can help with Kubernetes deployment?"
System: Searches direct skills, project history, related expertise,
        and learning interests to find the best matches
```

### 4. Historical Intelligence
```
User: "How long will the API refactoring take?"
System: Analyzes similar past projects, team velocities,
        and common bottlenecks to provide data-driven estimates
```

## Architecture Benefits

### Modular Design
- Each component is self-contained with clear interfaces
- Can use knowledge graph without PM features (and vice versa)
- Easy to extend with new modules

### AI-Agent Friendly
- Machine-readable module manifests
- Lazy loading context management  
- Reference touchpoint system
- Progressive enhancement

### Performance Optimized
- Load only what's needed for each query
- Intelligent caching strategies
- Streaming responses for large results

## Use Case Examples

### Pure Knowledge Graph Queries
- "Find all security policies"
- "Who reports to Sarah Johnson?"
- "List teams in the Engineering department"
- "Show me compliance frameworks for healthcare"

### Pure PM Operations  
- "Break down the mobile app feature"
- "Show current sprint progress"
- "Who's available for a React task?"
- "What are the current bottlenecks?"

### Integrated Intelligence
- "Form a team for HIPAA-compliant project" (uses policies + skills + availability)
- "Plan API upgrade considering dependencies" (uses team structure + project history)
- "Reassign Sarah's tasks - she's going on leave" (uses relationships + skills + bandwidth)

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1-2: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Core infrastructure for both systems
- Basic schema with all entities
- Module framework

### Phase 3: Dual Intelligence (Weeks 5-6)  
- Knowledge graph query engine
- PM task breakdown algorithms
- Integrated skill matching

### Phase 4-6: Enhancement & Launch (Weeks 7-12)
- Semantic understanding
- Learning systems
- Production deployment

## Success Metrics

### Knowledge Graph Metrics
- Query success rate > 95%
- Response time < 2s
- User satisfaction > 4.5/5

### PM Assistant Metrics
- Assignment satisfaction > 90%
- Estimation accuracy ± 20%
- Workload balance < 20% variance

### Integrated Value Metrics
- Policy compliance rate > 99%
- Cross-team collaboration efficiency +40%
- Project delivery predictability +60%

## Key Differentiator

This system is unique because it **combines organizational intelligence with project execution**. While other tools might do knowledge management OR project management, this platform uses your organizational knowledge to make better project decisions automatically.
