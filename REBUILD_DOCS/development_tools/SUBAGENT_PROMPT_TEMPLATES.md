# Sub-Agent Prompt Templates - No Compromise Edition

## Overview

These prompt templates are designed to be extremely explicit and leave no room for interpretation or compromise. Each template enforces strict boundaries and failure conditions.

## Template Categories

## Meta-Template for Custom Tasks

```
STRICT {TASK_TYPE} TASK

You are a {task_type}-only sub-agent with ONE specific objective.

OBJECTIVE: {specific_objective}
SCOPE: {exact_scope}
CONSTRAINTS: {hard_constraints}

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:
{numbered_requirements}

FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
{forbidden_list}

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
{checklist}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{exact_format}

FAILURE CONDITIONS:
{failure_triggers}

If ANY requirement cannot be met, respond with:
"TASK FAILED: [specific reason]"

Do NOT:
- Provide partial solutions
- Make compromises
- Deviate from specifications
- Add unrequested features
- Skip any requirements

Your response should be EITHER:
1. Complete successful execution meeting ALL criteria
2. Clear failure message with specific reason

Nothing else is acceptable.
```

## Usage with Orchestrator

```python
def create_strict_task(template_name: str, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Create a strict prompt from template"""
    template = load_template(template_name)
    
    # Validate all parameters are provided
    missing = [k for k in template.required_params if k not in params]
    if missing:
        raise ValueError(f"Missing required parameters: {missing}")
    
    # Format template with parameters
    prompt = template.format(**params)
    
    # Add execution timestamp
    prompt = f"EXECUTION TIME: {datetime.now().isoformat()}\n\n{prompt}"
    
    return prompt

# Example usage
doc_prompt = create_strict_task('documentation_update', {
    'task_id': 'doc_123',
    'changed_files': ['src/api.py', 'src/models.py'],
    'doc_files': ['README.md', 'docs/API.md']
})
```

## Prompt Validation

Each prompt should be validated before sending to sub-agent:

```python
def validate_prompt(prompt: str) -> bool:
    """Ensure prompt is sufficiently strict"""
    required_sections = [
        'ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS',
        'FORBIDDEN ACTIONS',
        'VALIDATION CRITERIA',
        'FAILURE TRIGGERS'
    ]
    
    for section in required_sections:
        if section not in prompt:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing required section: {section}")
    
    # Check for weak language
    weak_phrases = [
        'try to', 'attempt to', 'should', 'might',
        'possibly', 'preferably', 'if possible'
    ]
    
    for phrase in weak_phrases:
        if phrase in prompt.lower():
            raise ValueError(f"Prompt contains weak language: '{phrase}'")
    
    return True
```

## Key Principles

1. **Binary Outcomes**: Tasks either succeed completely or fail explicitly
2. **No Ambiguity**: Every requirement is measurable and specific
3. **Explicit Boundaries**: Clear scope with forbidden actions
4. **Verifiable Results**: All criteria can be programmatically checked
5. **Failure First**: Clear failure conditions prevent partial solutions

These templates ensure sub-agents operate within strict boundaries and deliver predictable, high-quality results without compromising on requirements.
