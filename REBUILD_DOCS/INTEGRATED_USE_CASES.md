# Integrated Use Cases: Knowledge Graph + PM Assistant

## Overview

This document demonstrates how the Enterprise Knowledge Graph and PM Assistant features work together to create a powerful organizational intelligence platform. The integration enables context-aware project management that leverages organizational knowledge.

## Integrated Workflows

### 1. Context-Aware Project Planning

When initiating a project, the system uses the knowledge graph to understand team capabilities:

```typescript
// User: "Plan a new payment integration project"

// System Process:
1. Query knowledge graph for payment expertise
2. Identify team members with Stripe/PayPal experience  
3. Check policy requirements for payment systems
4. Generate project plan with pre-assigned experts

// Response:
"I'll create a payment integration project plan. Based on our knowledge graph:

**Available Expertise:**
- David Chen: 3 Stripe projects, Python/Node.js
- Sarah Miller: PayPal integration experience
- Mike Johnson: PCI compliance expert

**Relevant Policies:**
- Payment Security Policy (owned by Security team)
- Data Encryption Standards (High priority)
- Third-party Integration Guidelines

**Generated Project Plan:**
Phase 1: Compliance Review (assigned to Mike)
- Review PCI requirements
- Security architecture design
..."
```

### 2. Policy-Aware Task Assignment

The PM assistant considers organizational policies when making assignments:

```typescript
// User: "Assign the customer data migration task"

// System checks:
1. Query: Which policies apply to customer data?
2. Find: GDPR compliance required, data team owns policy
3. Query: Who has GDPR certification?
4. Result: Filter assignees to certified team members

// Response:
"For the customer data migration task, I need to consider our data policies:

**Applicable Policies:**
- GDPR Compliance (owned by Data Governance team)
- Customer Data Handling Policy

**Qualified Assignees** (GDPR certified only):
- Lisa Park (Data Engineer, GDPR certified, 20h available)
- Tom Wilson (Senior Developer, GDPR certified, 15h available)

Recommending Lisa based on specialization and availability."
```

### 3. Skill Discovery for Project Needs

Leverage the knowledge graph to find hidden expertise:

```typescript
// User: "We need someone who knows Kubernetes for the deployment phase"

// System Process:
1. Direct search: Who has Kubernetes skill?
2. Indirect search: Who worked on projects using Kubernetes?
3. Related search: Who has Docker/containerization skills?
4. Learning search: Who expressed interest in learning Kubernetes?

// Response:
"I found several options for Kubernetes expertise:

**Direct Experience:**
- Alex Kumar: Kubernetes certified, 2 years experience
- Jenny Liu: Used K8s in Project Atlas last year

**Related Skills** (could handle with support):
- Ryan Torres: Strong Docker experience
- Sam Chen: DevOps background, containerization

**Growth Opportunity:**
- Emma Wilson: Requested Kubernetes training, strong general DevOps

Recommendation: Assign to Alex Kumar with Emma as shadow for learning."
```

### 4. Team Formation Using Organizational Structure

Form project teams considering reporting relationships and existing collaborations:

```typescript
// User: "Form a team for the mobile app project"

// System Analysis:
1. Query team structures and reporting lines
2. Identify successful past collaborations
3. Check for team balance (senior/junior mix)
4. Verify no conflicts with current assignments

// Response:
"Based on organizational structure and past collaborations:

**Recommended Core Team:**
- Lead: Sarah Johnson (Mobile Team Lead)
- iOS: David Lee (reports to Sarah, available 80%)
- Android: Lisa Chen (strong collaboration history with David)
- Backend: Tom Anderson (worked with team on API v2)
- QA: Mike Brown (Mobile QA specialist)

**Why this works:**
- Sarah and David have existing reporting relationship
- David and Lisa successfully delivered App v1.0 together
- Tom already knows the team's API preferences
- Balanced seniority (2 senior, 2 mid, 1 junior)"
```

### 5. Compliance-Driven Project Adjustments

Automatically adjust project plans based on compliance requirements:

```typescript
// User: "The healthcare client just confirmed HIPAA compliance is required"

// System Actions:
1. Query HIPAA compliance requirements
2. Identify required security controls
3. Find HIPAA-trained team members
4. Add compliance tasks to project

// Response:
"I've updated the project plan for HIPAA compliance:

**Added Tasks:**
- HIPAA compliance audit (assigned to Compliance team)
- Implement encryption at rest (assigned to Security team)
- Access control implementation
- Audit logging setup

**Team Adjustments:**
- Swapped John Doe → Mary Smith (HIPAA certified)
- Added Security Reviewer: Bob Wilson

**Timeline Impact:**
- Added 2 weeks for compliance implementation
- Moved delivery date to accommodate security review

**Required Policy Reviews:**
- Healthcare Data Policy
- Encryption Standards
- Access Control Framework"
```

### 6. Historical Intelligence for Estimation

Use knowledge graph data for better project estimates:

```typescript
// User: "How long will the API refactoring take?"

// System Analysis:
1. Query similar past projects
2. Find who worked on them and their velocities
3. Identify common bottlenecks from history
4. Adjust for current team composition

// Response:
"Based on historical data from our knowledge graph:

**Similar Projects:**
- API v2 Refactor (2023): 6 weeks, 3 developers
- Payment Service Refactor: 4 weeks, 2 developers
- Auth System Rewrite: 8 weeks, 4 developers

**Your Team's Historical Velocity:**
- Sarah: Delivered 20% faster than estimates
- David: On-time delivery rate 95%
- New team member: Apply 30% learning curve

**Estimate: 5 weeks** with current team
- Base estimate: 6 weeks (from similar projects)
- Adjusted for team velocity: -1 week
- Risk buffer for dependencies: +2 days

**Historical Bottlenecks to Avoid:**
- Database migration took 2x longer in past
- Integration tests were underestimated
- Consider adding dedicated QA from week 3"
```

### 7. Cross-Functional Dependency Management

Identify and manage dependencies across organizational boundaries:

```typescript
// User: "What dependencies exist for the platform upgrade project?"

// System Process:
1. Query all teams affected by platform
2. Identify policy compliance requirements
3. Find integration points
4. Check resource availability across teams

// Response:
"I've identified critical dependencies across the organization:

**Team Dependencies:**
- Infrastructure Team: Must complete K8s upgrade first
- Security Team: Needs to approve new platform version
- Data Team: Requires migration plan for analytics

**Policy Dependencies:**
- Change Management Policy requires 2-week notice
- Security Review Policy mandates penetration testing
- Data Retention Policy affects migration approach

**Resource Conflicts:**
- Tom Anderson needed by both your project and Data team
- Security review slot not available until March 15

**Recommended Sequencing:**
1. Start with Infrastructure Team's prep work
2. Parallel: Security approval + Data migration plan
3. Your team begins after prerequisites (March 20)

**Critical Path:** Infrastructure upgrade → Security approval → Platform upgrade"
```

### 8. Smart Resource Reallocation

Dynamically adjust assignments based on organizational changes:

```typescript
// User: "Sarah just announced she's going on leave next month"

// System Response:
"I'll help reorganize tasks around Sarah's absence. Analyzing impact:

**Sarah's Current Assignments:**
- Frontend Authentication (critical path)
- UI Polish Tasks (nice-to-have)
- Code Reviews (ongoing)

**Recommended Reallocations:**

1. **Frontend Authentication → David Lee**
   - Has React experience from Project Nova
   - Worked with Sarah on similar features
   - Can maintain critical path

2. **UI Polish → Defer or Lisa Chen**
   - Not on critical path
   - Lisa has design background

3. **Code Reviews → Distributed**
   - Mike: JavaScript reviews
   - Tom: API-related reviews

**Knowledge Transfer Plan:**
- Week 1: Sarah pairs with David on auth design
- Week 2: Document critical decisions
- Week 3: Gradual handoff with overlap
- Week 4: David fully owns, Sarah available for questions

**Updated Timeline:** No impact if handoff executes well"
```
