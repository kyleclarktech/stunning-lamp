# Implementation Roadmap - Agentic PM Assistant PoC

## Overview

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to building the Agentic PM Assistant System Proof of Concept (PoC). The system leverages an enterprise knowledge graph for natural language queries and provides a bounded, LLM-driven tool to assist in project decomposition. The primary goal is to validate the architecture and core functionality.

---

## Phase 0: Vertical Slice & Integration Test (Week 1)

### Goal
- De-risk the architecture by building a single, end-to-end functional slice that touches every core module.

### Deliverables
```yaml
tasks:
  - name: "Project Scaffolding"
    components:
      - Module system framework
      - TypeScript configuration
      - Testing framework (Vitest)
      - Basic logging and error handling

  - name: "End-to-End 'Find Person' Query"
    components:
      - `@api-gateway`: Stub with a single `/query` endpoint.
      - `@query-engine`: Stub that returns a hardcoded Cypher query for "find person by name".
      - `@graph-executor`: Connects to Neo4j and executes the hardcoded query.
      - `@response-formatter`: Stub that returns raw JSON from the database.
      - `@context-manager`: Stubbed out, not used in this phase.
      - `@pm-assistant`: Stubbed out, not used in this phase.

  - name: "Configuration Management Setup"
    components:
      - Create root `.env.example` file with all required configurations
      - Implement configuration loader module
      - Document all environment variables
  
  - name: "Integration Test Suite"
    components:
      - A single integration test that sends a request to the gateway and asserts a valid JSON response.
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] A single command (`npm test`) can run the integration test, which starts the necessary modules and successfully queries the database.
- [ ] The test proves that all 6 core modules can be loaded and can communicate with each other.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Weeks 2-3)

### Goals
- Establish the full modular architecture.
- Set up the graph database with the PoC schema.
- Create core infrastructure for agent-driven development.

### Deliverables

#### Week 2: Architecture & Tooling
```yaml
tasks:
  - name: "Module Container"
    components: [Module loader, Dependency injection, Lifecycle management]
  - name: "Development Tools"
    components: [Module generator CLI, Touchpoint update script, CI check for stale touchpoints]
```

#### Week 3: Core Systems
```yaml
tasks:
  - name: "AI-Agent Indexing System"
    components: [Index structure, Index generator, Search capabilities]
  - name: "Context Management Foundation"
    components: [Context loader interface, Caching layer, Context scoring]
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Module system can load and unload all modules dynamically.
- [ ] `npm run update-touchpoints` command is functional.
- [ ] CI pipeline fails if code comments with `@touchpoint` are changed without running the update script.

---

## Phase 2: Core Modules & API (Weeks 4-5)

### Goals
- Implement essential modules for querying and data handling.
- Establish the human-friendly API Gateway.

### Deliverables

#### Week 4: Data Layer
```yaml
modules:
  - id: "@graph-executor"
    features: [Neo4j connection, Query execution, Transaction support]
    touchpoints: [Connection patterns, Error handling]
```

#### Week 5: Interface Layer
```yaml
modules:
  - id: "@api-gateway"
    features: [REST server (Fastify/Express), Stateless API design, Route handlers for core functions, OpenAPI/Swagger documentation]
  - id: "@response-formatter"
    features: [JSON formatting, Markdown rendering, Table generation]
  - id: "CLI Client"
    features:
      - Command-line interface for API interaction
      - Conversation history management with configurable context window
      - Interactive mode for PM assistance
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] `@graph-executor` can handle 100 concurrent queries in testing.
- [ ] `@api-gateway` exposes at least three functional endpoints (e.g., `/query`, `/modules`, `/status`).
- [ ] API documentation is auto-generated and accessible via a browser.

---

## Phase 3: Intelligence Engines (Weeks 6-8)

### Goals
- Build the natural language query engine.
- Implement the bounded PM Decomposer.

### Deliverables

#### Week 6-7: Query Intelligence
```yaml
modules:
  - id: "@query-engine"
    features: [NL parsing, Intent classification, Cypher generation]
    ai_integration: [LLM-driven query generation prompts]
```

#### Week 8: PM Assistant
```yaml
modules:
  - id: "@pm-assistant"
    features:
      - Reads existing project state from the graph
      - Interactive task creation with redundancy detection
      - Generates structured task drafts (NEW/DUPLICATE/MODIFICATION)
    ai_integration: [State-aware LLM prompts for task assistance]
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] `@query-engine` can successfully convert 70%+ of test queries into valid Cypher.
- [ ] `@pm-assistant` can read project context and draft new tasks with proper redundancy analysis.
- [ ] Agent-assisted semantic validation confirms output quality for PM tasks.

## Phase 4: Smart Features & Agent Integration (Weeks 9-10)

### Goals
- Add semantic understanding to improve query success.
- Complete AI-agent compatibility features.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
```yaml
risks:
  - risk: "LLM-driven components are unreliable"
    mitigation:
      - Use strict, version-controlled prompts.
      - Implement validation layers for LLM outputs.
      - Define clear, simple protocols for LLM interaction.
  - risk: "Module system integration is complex"
    mitigation:
      - The "Vertical Slice" phase is designed to de-risk this early.
      - Use contract testing between modules.
```

### Timeline Risks
```yaml
risks:
  - risk: "Scope creep beyond PoC"
    mitigation:
      - Adhere strictly to the phased deliverables.
      - Defer all performance and scalability work.
      - Maintain a "Post-PoC" backlog for future ideas.
