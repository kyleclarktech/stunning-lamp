# GRAPH_SCHEMA_UNIFIED.md Review Findings

## Executive Summary

The GRAPH_SCHEMA_UNIFIED.md document provides a comprehensive graph schema definition that successfully unifies organizational knowledge and project management data in Neo4j. However, the review identified several critical issues including FalkorDB-specific syntax, missing node types referenced in other documents, property inconsistencies, and alignment gaps with module specifications.

## Schema Completeness Assessment

### Overall Completeness: 85%

**Strengths:**
- Covers all core organizational entities (Person, Team, Group, Policy)
- Includes comprehensive PM entities (Project, Task, Skill, Sprint)
- Well-defined relationship types with properties
- Good query examples covering common use cases
- Clear migration strategy from array properties to relationships

**Gaps:**
- Missing several node types referenced in other documents
- Incomplete property definitions for some entities
- Missing relationship types used in other specifications
- No versioning or temporal properties for tracking changes

## Specific Findings with Evidence

### 1. FalkorDB-Specific Syntax Issues

**Finding:** The schema contains FalkorDB-specific syntax that needs conversion to Neo4j standard.

**Evidence:**
- Line 299: `ASSERT p.email IS UNIQUE` - Should be `ASSERT (p.email) IS UNIQUE`
- Throughout: Array properties like `skills: [String]` and `tags: [String]` - Neo4j uses list syntax differently
- Line 395: Migration script uses `UNWIND` without proper Neo4j syntax formatting

**Impact:** Queries will fail in Neo4j without syntax corrections.

### 2. Missing Node Types Referenced in Other Documents

**Finding:** Several node types mentioned in other specifications are missing from the schema.

**Evidence from REBUILD_PRD.md:**
```typescript
// Line 282-298: These entities are defined but missing from schema
interface Assignment {
  id: string;
  task_id: string;
  person_id: string;
  // ... more properties
}

interface BandwidthRecord {
  person_id: string;
  week_starting: Date;
  allocated_hours: number;
  // ... more properties
}
```

**Missing Node Types:**
- `Assignment` - Referenced in PRD as a separate entity, but only exists as a relationship in schema
- `BandwidthRecord` - Mentioned in PRD but completely absent from schema
- `Comment` - Referenced in Task interface but not defined
- `Location` - Used in Person interface but not defined
- `Requirement` - Used in Policy but not defined as node or property structure

### 3. Property Definition Inconsistencies

**Finding:** Properties defined in schema don't align with those used in other documents.

**Evidence:**

From GRAPH_SCHEMA_UNIFIED.md (Line 23-34):
```cypher
(:Person {
  availability: Integer // Hours available per week
})
```

From PM_CAPABILITIES_SPEC.md (Line 14):
```cypher
(person:Person {id, name, skills: [], availability: 40})
```

From REBUILD_PRD.md (Line 364):
```typescript
interface BandwidthRecord {
  allocated_hours: number;
  available_hours: number;
  // More sophisticated bandwidth tracking
}
```

**Inconsistencies:**
- `availability` is too simplistic - other docs suggest more complex bandwidth tracking
- Missing temporal aspects of availability (per week, time windows)
- No accommodation for PTO, partial availability, or scheduling conflicts

### 4. Relationship Properties Misalignment

**Finding:** Relationship properties in schema don't match usage in other documents.

**Evidence:**

Schema definition (Line 210-218):
```cypher
(p:Person)-[:ASSIGNED_TO {
  assigned_at: DateTime
  assigned_by: String   // Person ID who made assignment
  confidence: Float     // Assignment confidence score
  reason: String        // Why this person was chosen
  status: String        // 'active' | 'completed' | 'declined'
}]->(t:Task)
```

PM_CAPABILITIES_SPEC.md usage (Line 276):
```cypher
CREATE (p)-[a:ASSIGNED_TO {
  assigned_at: datetime(),
  confidence: skillMatch * 1.0 / SIZE((t)-[:REQUIRES]->()),
  status: 'active'
}]->(t)
```

**Issues:**
- `assigned_by` and `reason` properties not used in implementation
- Missing properties like `completed_at` for tracking assignment lifecycle

### 5. Missing Graph Features for PM Functionality

**Finding:** Schema lacks several graph patterns needed for PM features described in other docs.

**Evidence from PM_CAPABILITIES_SPEC.md:**
- Learning goals pattern using `WANTS_TO_LEARN` relationship (Line 249-256)
- Skill similarity using `SIMILAR_TO` relationship (Line 259-265)
- Both are defined in schema but not used in any query examples

**Missing Patterns:**
- No temporal relationships for tracking history
- No approval/review relationships for tasks
- No notification relationships for alerts
- No integration relationships for external systems

### 6. Index and Constraint Issues

**Finding:** Index definitions use non-standard Neo4j syntax.

**Evidence (Lines 294-315):**
```cypher
CREATE INDEX person_name FOR (p:Person) ON (p.name);
```

**Correct Neo4j 4.x+ Syntax:**
```cypher
CREATE INDEX person_name FOR (p:Person) ON p.name;
```

### 7. Query Pattern Errors

**Finding:** Several query examples contain errors or inefficiencies.

**Evidence (Line 323-327):**
```cypher
MATCH (t:Task {id: $taskId})-[:REQUIRES]->(s:Skill)
MATCH (p:Person)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s)
WHERE p.availability > 0
```

**Issues:**
- Two separate MATCH clauses for the same skill node is inefficient
- Should check for existing assignments to avoid double-booking
- Doesn't consider skill level requirements

### 8. Schema Evolution Section Incomplete

**Finding:** Schema evolution guidelines are vague and lack concrete examples.

**Evidence (Lines 441-460):**
- Only provides high-level guidance
- No versioning strategy for tracking schema changes
- No migration scripts for common evolution scenarios
- Missing rollback procedures

## Cross-Document Alignment Check

### 1. Module Interface Alignment

**MODULE_BOUNDARIES_SPEC.md** defines interfaces that expect certain schema elements:

```typescript
// Line 165: PMAssistantModule interface expects these operations
createProject(description: string): Promise<Project>;
breakdownProject(projectId: string): Promise<Task[]>;
```

**Schema Gap:** No `description` property on Project node in schema, but used in interface.

### 2. Event System Alignment

**SYNCHRONIZATION_STRATEGY.md** defines events that reference entities:

```typescript
// Line 84: Event payload structure
payload: { 
  projectId: project.id,
  description,
  createdBy: currentUser
}
```

**Schema Gap:** `createdBy` not consistently defined across all entities that emit creation events.

### 3. AI Agent Context Alignment

**AI_AGENT_INDEXING_SPEC.md** expects certain query patterns:

```json
// Line 200: AI hints in schema
"query_patterns": ["find {name}", "who is {name}", "{name}'s manager"]
```

**Schema Gap:** No structured way to store these query pattern hints in the graph itself.

## Missing Elements Needed by Other Modules

### 1. From PM_CAPABILITIES_SPEC.md

**Required but Missing:**
- Sprint planning relationships (Sprint nodes defined but not connected)
- Resource allocation tracking beyond simple availability
- Time tracking for actual vs estimated hours at a granular level
- Team formation patterns and history

### 2. From INTEGRATED_USE_CASES.md

**Required but Missing:**
- Compliance tracking relationships
- External system integration nodes
- Notification/alert entities
- Historical performance data structure

### 3. From REBUILD_PRD.md

**Required but Missing:**
- User context tracking
- Query history for learning
- Preference storage for individuals
- Capability/certification tracking beyond skills

## Conclusion

The GRAPH_SCHEMA_UNIFIED.md provides a solid foundation but requires significant updates to fully support the system described in other documents. The primary issues are FalkorDB syntax remnants, missing entities, and property misalignments. With the recommended fixes, the schema will properly support both the knowledge graph and PM assistant functionality in a unified Neo4j database.
