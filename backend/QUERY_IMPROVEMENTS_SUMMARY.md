# Query Generation System Improvements Summary

## Date: 2025-06-19

## Overview
Successfully implemented major improvements to the Cypher query generation system for FalkorDB integration, addressing key issues identified in testing.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Fuzzy Matching
- **Change**: Replaced exact matching with CONTAINS operator for better partial matches
- **Implementation**: Added explicit fuzzy matching instructions in prompt (instruction #13)
- **Examples**:
  - Team names: `WHERE t.name CONTAINS 'mobile' OR t.name CONTAINS 'Mobile'`
  - Person names: `WHERE p.name CONTAINS 'Sarah'`
  - Roles: `WHERE role CONTAINS 'CTO' OR role CONTAINS 'Chief Technology'`
  - Policies: `WHERE p.category CONTAINS 'compliance' OR p.name CONTAINS 'compliance' OR p.description CONTAINS 'compliance'`

### 2. Role vs Name Understanding
- **Change**: Added explicit detection logic for role titles vs person names
- **Implementation**: Instruction #12 now differentiates between role searches and name searches
- **Role Detection**: CTO, CEO, Director, Manager, Lead, VP, President → search by role property
- **Name Detection**: Proper names → search by name property
- **Example**: "the CTO" triggers `WHERE role CONTAINS 'CTO'` not `WHERE name = 'CTO'`

### 3. Sophisticated Query Patterns
Added 7 new complex query patterns:
- **Aggregate Queries**: Count team members, find team with most members
- **Multi-hop Traversals**: Find teammates of people who report to specific roles
- **Cross-functional Queries**: People in both teams and groups
- **Policy Searches**: High severity policies with responsible parties
- **Department Hierarchies**: All managers in a department
- **Date-based Queries**: Recent hires (using string comparison for ISO dates)
- **Negative Queries**: Teams without managers

### 4. Fixed Technical Issues
- **WHERE Clause Placement**: Clear instruction that WHERE must come after the entire pattern
- **Date Functions**: Replaced unsupported `datetime()` with string comparisons
- **Output Format**: Stricter instruction to output ONLY the Cypher query on one line

### 5. Search Query Improvements
- Updated `search_query.txt` to use CONTAINS instead of regex
- Search multiple fields per entity type for better coverage
- Return up to 25 results by default

## Testing Results

### Successful Queries
1. **"who works on the mobile team?"**
   - Generated: `MATCH (p:Person)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(t:Team) WHERE t.name CONTAINS 'mobile' OR t.name CONTAINS 'Mobile' RETURN ...`
   - Result: ✅ 25 results found (previously 0)

2. **"find Sarah's manager"**
   - Generated: `MATCH (p:Person)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(m:Person) WHERE p.name CONTAINS 'Sarah' RETURN ...`
   - Result: ✅ 2 managers found for people named Sarah

3. **"which teams are responsible for compliance policies?"**
   - Generated: `MATCH (t)-[:RESPONSIBLE_FOR]->(p:Policy) WHERE p.category CONTAINS 'compliance' OR p.name CONTAINS 'compliance' OR p.description CONTAINS 'compliance' RETURN ...`
   - Result: ✅ 3 teams/groups found

4. **"which team has the most members?"**
   - Generated: `MATCH (p:Person)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(t:Team) RETURN ... count(p) as member_count ORDER BY member_count DESC LIMIT 1`
   - Result: ✅ QA Automation team with 30 members

## Remaining Considerations

### 1. Date Queries
- FalkorDB doesn't support `datetime()` or `duration()` functions
- Current solution uses string comparison with ISO dates
- For "last 30 days" type queries, the application layer needs to calculate the date

### 2. Full-text Search
- FalkorDB has limited text search capabilities
- CONTAINS operator works but is case-sensitive
- Consider adding case variations in queries for better matches

### 3. Query Complexity
- Very complex multi-hop queries may need optimization
- Consider adding query timeout handling in production

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Use `debug_query_tool.py` to test query generation:
   ```bash
   python debug_query_tool.py --nl "your natural language query"
   ```

2. Test specific Cypher queries:
   ```bash
   python debug_query_tool.py --query "MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p LIMIT 5"
   ```

3. Validate schema:
   ```bash
   python debug_query_tool.py --validate
   ```

### For Prompt Engineering
- Keep instructions clear and specific
- Include plenty of examples in the prompt
- Use CONTAINS for fuzzy matching
- Be explicit about output format requirements

## Conclusion
The query generation system now handles fuzzy matching, role-based searches, and complex query patterns effectively. The improvements significantly increase the system's ability to understand user intent and return relevant results from the FalkorDB graph database.
