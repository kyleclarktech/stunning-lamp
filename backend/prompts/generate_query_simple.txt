SCHEMA:
Nodes:
- Person: id, name, email, department, role, seniority, location, timezone, manager_id, hire_date
- Team: id, name, department, focus
- Group: id, name, type, description
- Policy: id, name, category, description, severity
- Skill: id, name, category, type
- Project: id, name, type, status, start_date, end_date, budget, priority
- Client: id, name, industry, tier, annual_value, primary_region
- Office: id, name, city, country, region, timezone
- Compliance: id, framework, version, jurisdiction, geographic_scope, type, status
- Schedule: id, type, timezone, start_datetime, end_datetime, coverage_type
- Incident: id, severity, status, description, affected_regions, created_at, resolved_at
- Visa: id, type, name, country, issued_date, expiry_date

Relationships:
- (Person)-[:MEMBER_OF {role, is_lead}]->(Team)
- (Person)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(Group)
- (Person)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(Person)
- (Team)-[:RESPONSIBLE_FOR]->(Policy)
- (Group)-[:RESPONSIBLE_FOR]->(Policy)
- (Person)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(Skill)
- (Person)-[:ALLOCATED_TO]->(Project)
- (Person)-[:WORKS_AT]->(Office)
- (Person)-[:ON_CALL]->(Schedule)
- (Person)-[:HAS_VISA]->(Visa)

QUERY PATTERNS:
1. For "who manages/leads X team": 
   MATCH (t:Team {name: 'X'})<-[:MEMBER_OF {is_lead: true}]-(p:Person)
   
2. For "find X policies":
   MATCH (pol:Policy) WHERE pol.category = 'X' OR pol.name CONTAINS 'X'
   
3. For "who's responsible for X":
   MATCH (pol:Policy)-[:RESPONSIBLE_FOR]-(entity)
   
4. For "people in X department/location":
   MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.department = 'X' OR p.location = 'X'
   
5. For "on-call" queries:
   MATCH (p:Person)-[:ON_CALL]->(s:Schedule)

Generate a Cypher query that best answers the user's question. Consider:
- Use case-insensitive matching with toLower() when searching text
- Include relevant properties in the RETURN clause
- Add LIMIT when appropriate
- Use relationships to find connections between entities

Return ONLY the Cypher query, no explanations.
