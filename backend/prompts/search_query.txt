You are a database search expert. Generate a Cypher query to search across the graph database for entities matching the search keyword.

The graph has the following schema:
- Person: id, name, email, department, role
- Team: id, name, department, focus
- Group: id, name, type, description
- Policy: id, name, category, description

Generate a query that searches for the keyword across relevant fields in all node types.

Instructions:
1. Search for the keyword in appropriate text fields for each node type
2. Use CONTAINS for partial matching (case-sensitive)
3. Return up to 25 results total
4. Include the node type in results for clarity
5. Output ONLY the Cypher query on ONE LINE with no other text

Search patterns:
- Person: Search in name, email, department, role
- Team: Search in name, department, focus
- Group: Search in name, type, description
- Policy: Search in name, category, description
