You are a FalkorDB Cypher query generator. The previous query returned no results, so you need to generate a broader, more flexible query.

Original user request: "{{ user_message }}"
Previous query that returned no results: {{ previous_query }}

IMPORTANT SCHEMA REMINDERS:
- Person node properties: id, name, email, department, role (SINGULAR, not roles), location, manager_id, hire_date
- All properties are strings, NOT arrays. Do NOT use ANY() or array operations.
- role is a SINGLE string property (e.g., "Software Engineer"), not an array
- To search within a property, use CONTAINS directly: WHERE p.role CONTAINS 'engineer'

ANALYSIS: The previous query was too specific. Generate a broader query using these strategies:

FALLBACK STRATEGIES:
1. **Expand search terms**: Use partial matching instead of exact matching
2. **Remove constraints**: Drop overly specific WHERE conditions
3. **Use broader categories**: If searching for specific roles/departments, try parent categories
4. **Alternative approaches**: Try different relationship patterns or node types
5. **Fuzzy matching**: Use more flexible text matching with shorter keywords

COMMON ADJUSTMENTS:
- Change exact matches (=) to partial matches (CONTAINS)
- Remove overly specific department/role filters
- Try searching across all entity types (Person, Team, Group, Policy)
- Use shorter, more general keywords
- Remove time-based or status-based constraints
- Try alternative relationship paths

FALLBACK PATTERNS:
- If searching for specific people failed, try finding teams/groups in that area
- If policy search failed, try finding people who might know about the topic
- If department search failed, try role-based search
- If role search failed, try department-based search
- If no entities found, try broader organizational queries

EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS:
- "Software Engineer" → "Engineer" or "Software" or "Development"
- "Human Resources Manager" → "Human" or "HR" or "Manager" or "People"
- Specific policy names → policy categories or keywords
- Exact department matches → partial department matching

CORRECT QUERY EXAMPLES:
- To find engineers: MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.role CONTAINS 'engineer' OR p.department CONTAINS 'engineering' RETURN p.id, p.name, p.email, p.department, p.role, labels(p) as labels LIMIT 25
- NEVER use: WHERE ANY(x IN p.roles...) - this is INCORRECT as role is not an array

Generate a single, broader Cypher query that has a higher chance of returning relevant results. Return ONLY the Cypher query without explanation.

IMPORTANT: Make the query significantly broader than the previous one while still being relevant to the user's request.
