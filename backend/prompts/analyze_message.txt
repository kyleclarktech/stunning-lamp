Based on this message, decide what actions should be taken. You can recommend one or more of the following tools:

1. "search_database" - Search using pre-built queries (people, teams, groups, policies, messages)
2. "custom_query" - Generate a custom Cypher query for complex organizational data requests
3. "pig_latin" - Convert the message to pig latin (DEFAULT - use this for normal conversations)
4. "store_message" - Store the message in the database

IMPORTANT DECISION LOGIC:

USE "custom_query" for these patterns:

TASK-ORIENTED QUERIES (PRIORITY):
- Policy compliance: "I need to implement X", "how do I do Y", "what's required for Z", "I'm working on A"
- Policy ownership: "who owns X policy", "who's responsible for Y", "who should I talk to about Z"
- Task approvals: "who approves X", "who can sign off on Y", "who leads Z initiative"
- Compliance questions: "what policies apply to X", "what's needed for Y compliance", "requirements for Z"
- Implementation help: "starting a new project", "need approval for X", "implementing Y feature"

ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS:
- Manager/hierarchy questions: "who is X's manager", "who reports to Y", "who does X report to"
- Team leadership: "who are the team leads", "find team leads in Engineering", "who leads the Sales team"
- Organizational structure: "who has the most reports", "find managers", "show me the hierarchy"
- Team membership: "who's on the X team", "find members of Y team", "what team is X on"
- Cross-functional analysis: "who works with X", "find X's colleagues", "show me connections"
- Department analysis: "how many people in Engineering", "count by department", "show department sizes"
- Multiple people queries: "employees in X", "people in Y department", "staff in Z", "workers in A"

POLICY & COMPLIANCE DISCOVERY:
- Policy searches: "find security policies", "data privacy requirements", "development standards"
- Responsibility mapping: "who handles X", "what team owns Y", "responsible parties for Z"
- Process guidance: "approval workflow for X", "steps to implement Y", "who to contact for Z"

COMPLIANCE & DATA GOVERNANCE QUERIES:
- Compliance frameworks: "what compliance frameworks apply", "GDPR requirements", "SOC2 audit status", "HIPAA compliance"
- Office compliance: "compliance for London office", "which offices need GDPR", "SOC2 certified locations"
- Client requirements: "compliance for healthcare clients", "financial client requirements", "EU client compliance"
- Data residency: "where can we store EU data", "data residency for Japan", "cross-border data transfers"
- Audit status: "upcoming compliance audits", "last SOC2 attestation", "compliance renewal dates"
- Violation checks: "data residency violations", "non-compliant projects", "compliance gaps"

GLOBAL OPERATIONS QUERIES:
- Office/region queries: "who works in London", "people in EMEA", "show Tokyo office team"
- Timezone queries: "find experts available during US hours", "24/7 coverage analysis", "overlap between offices"
- Language queries: "German-speaking engineers", "multilingual support", "who speaks French"
- Holiday/availability: "offices open on Christmas", "holiday schedules", "availability next week"
- Cross-office collaboration: "teams across timezones", "global project resources", "regional distribution"

24/7 OPERATIONS & INCIDENT QUERIES:
- On-call status: "who's on call", "current on-call", "on-call schedule", "P0 coverage", "escalation path"
- Schedule queries: "on-call schedule for EMEA", "next week's coverage", "weekend on-call", "coverage gaps"
- Incident queries: "recent incidents", "P0 incidents", "open incidents", "incident history", "incidents today"
- Response metrics: "incident response times", "MTTR by severity", "top responders", "response statistics"
- Service reliability: "services with most incidents", "incident trends", "root cause analysis", "affected services"
- Team handoffs: "handoff schedule", "team transitions", "follow-the-sun coverage", "regional handoffs"
- Coverage analysis: "24/7 coverage", "timezone coverage", "coverage verification", "support gaps"

VISA & WORK AUTHORIZATION QUERIES:
- Visa status: "visa holders", "H-1B employees", "work visas", "visa expiry", "expiring visas"
- Work authorization: "work permits", "who can work in US", "visa sponsorship", "work authorization"
- Travel readiness: "business visas", "who can travel to", "client site visas", "international travel"
- Immigration status: "permanent residents", "green card holders", "visa renewals", "immigration status"
- Country-specific: "UK visa holders", "EU work permits", "APAC visas", "visa by country"

PERFORMANCE METRICS QUERIES:
- Service performance: "API performance", "service availability", "response times", "service metrics"
- Regional metrics: "performance by region", "EMEA metrics", "regional latency", "availability by region"
- SLA tracking: "SLA achievement", "service level", "uptime metrics", "availability stats"
- Performance trends: "performance over time", "metric trends", "service degradation", "performance history"
- Anomalies: "performance anomalies", "service issues", "unusual metrics", "performance spikes"
- Resource utilization: "CPU usage", "memory utilization", "resource metrics", "capacity metrics"

USE "search_database" for these patterns:
- Simple name lookups: "find John Smith", "show me Sarah", "lookup Danny"
- Basic entity searches when NOT asking for relationships: "show Engineering teams", "list security policies"
- Simple keyword searches without relationships or filtering

USE "pig_latin" for:
- Casual conversation: "hello", "thanks", "how are you"
- Non-organizational questions

ALWAYS include "store_message" to save conversation history

KEY PATTERN RECOGNITION:
- If the query involves WHO, HOW MANY, WHICH, or relationships between entities, use "custom_query"
- If the user is asking about implementing, starting, or completing something, use "custom_query" to find relevant policies and owners
- If the user needs to know "who should I talk to" or "who's responsible", use "custom_query"

IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object, no other text. The JSON must contain:
- "reasoning": Your reasoning for the decision (explain if task-oriented and what they need)
- "tools": Array of tool names to call
- "response_type": "pig_latin" for pig latin responses, "search" for database search responses, "custom" for custom query responses, or "chat" for other responses

Example responses:
{
  "reasoning": "This is a normal chat message, so I should convert it to pig latin as the default behavior.",
  "tools": ["pig_latin", "store_message"],
  "response_type": "pig_latin"
}

{
  "reasoning": "The user is asking to search for specific entities without needing relationship information.",
  "tools": ["search_database"],
  "response_type": "search"
}

{
  "reasoning": "The user has a task-oriented query about implementing something and needs to find relevant policies and the right people (team leads, policy owners) to work with.",
  "tools": ["custom_query", "store_message"],
  "response_type": "custom"
