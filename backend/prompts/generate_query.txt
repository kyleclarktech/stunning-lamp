KEYWORD SYNONYMS & ALIASES:
When matching user requests, treat these terms as equivalent:

DEPARTMENTS & AREAS:
- "human resources", "hr", "people ops", "people operations" → use 'human resources' or 'hr'
- "information technology", "it", "tech", "technology" → use 'it' or 'technology'  
- "research and development", "r&d", "rnd", "product development" → use 'research' or 'development'
- "customer service", "support", "customer support", "help desk" → use 'support' or 'customer'
- "quality assurance", "qa", "quality control", "qc", "testing" → use 'quality' or 'testing'
- "business development", "bd", "biz dev", "partnerships" → use 'business' or 'development'
- "operations", "ops", "operational" → use 'operations'
- "finance", "accounting", "financial" → use 'finance'
- "marketing", "brand", "communications", "comms" → use 'marketing'
- "sales", "revenue", "business development" → use 'sales'
- "legal", "compliance", "regulatory" → use 'legal' or 'compliance'
- "security", "infosec", "cybersecurity", "information security" → use 'security'

ROLES & POSITIONS:
- "manager", "lead", "supervisor", "head" → match against role field with these variants
- "director", "dir", "vp", "vice president" → match senior roles
- "engineer", "dev", "developer", "programmer" → use 'engineer' or 'developer'
- "analyst", "specialist", "coordinator" → use base terms
- "administrator", "admin", "ops" → use 'admin' or 'operations'

POLICY CATEGORIES:
- "data protection", "privacy", "gdpr", "pii" → use 'privacy' or 'data'
- "information security", "infosec", "cybersecurity" → use 'security'
- "access control", "iam", "identity", "authentication" → use 'access' or 'identity'
- "incident response", "incident management", "emergency" → use 'incident'
- "change management", "change control", "deployment" → use 'change'
- "risk management", "risk assessment", "compliance" → use 'risk' or 'compliance'

SEARCH STRATEGY:
- Use multiple synonyms in OR conditions: toLower(field) CONTAINS toLower('term1') OR toLower(field) CONTAINS toLower('term2')
- For departments, check both full names and abbreviations
- For roles, use CONTAINS to catch variations (e.g., "Senior Engineer", "Lead Engineer")
- Be flexible with matching but prioritize exact matches first

Generate a Cypher query that answers the user's request. Return ONLY the Cypher query without explanation.

QUERY OPTIMIZATION GUIDELINES:
- Use case-insensitive matching: toLower(field) CONTAINS toLower('search_term')
- Only include LIMIT when the user explicitly asks to limit results (e.g., "show me the top 5", "first 10 results")
- Use DISTINCT when needed to avoid duplicates
- Order results logically (by severity for policies, by role hierarchy for people, etc.)
- For name searches, use partial matching with CONTAINS
- Use appropriate variable-length paths for hierarchies: [:REPORTS_TO*1..3]
- Return meaningful contact info: names, roles, emails, departments
- For task-oriented queries, prioritize leads, managers, and policy owners
- Always include email addresses when returning people for task collaboration

IMPORTANT - PRECISE MATCHING:
- Be specific with search terms - if the user asks for "security policies", use search terms like 'security' 
- Don't broaden searches unnecessarily - if no exact matches exist, the query should return empty results
- Avoid generic fallback queries that might return unrelated results
- Let the formatting layer handle empty results appropriately rather than trying to find "close enough" matches
