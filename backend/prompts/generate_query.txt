SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING:

1. GENERIC ORGANIZATIONAL TERMS (map to ALL Person nodes):
   - "employees", "staff", "people", "workforce", "personnel", "colleagues" → MATCH (p:Person)
   - "everyone", "all staff", "entire team" → MATCH (p:Person)
   - Example: "How many employees?" → MATCH (p:Person) RETURN count(p) as count

2. ROLE CATEGORIES (use CONTAINS with OR for multiple keywords):
   - "developers", "engineers" → role CONTAINS 'Engineer' OR role CONTAINS 'Developer' 
   - "managers", "leaders" → role CONTAINS 'Manager' OR role CONTAINS 'Lead' OR role CONTAINS 'Director' OR role CONTAINS 'VP'
   - "executives" → role CONTAINS 'VP' OR role CONTAINS 'Chief' OR role CONTAINS 'President' OR role CONTAINS 'CTO' OR role CONTAINS 'CEO'
   - "analysts" → role CONTAINS 'Analyst' OR role CONTAINS 'Scientist'
   - "consultants" → role CONTAINS 'Consultant' OR role CONTAINS 'Advisor'

3. DEPARTMENT GROUPINGS:
   - "engineering team" → department CONTAINS 'Engineering' OR department CONTAINS 'Data Platform' OR department CONTAINS 'Infrastructure'
   - "sales organization" → department CONTAINS 'Sales'
   - "support teams" → department CONTAINS 'Customer Success' OR department CONTAINS 'Professional Services'

QUERY GENERATION RULES:

1. Analyze the user's question for semantic meaning, not just keywords
2. Construct a SINGLE Cypher statement (no semicolons, no multiple queries)
3. Return ONLY the Cypher query on ONE LINE with NO other text
4. Always return the `id` property and `labels()` for nodes
5. Limit results to 25 unless counting or specifically requested otherwise
6. Use CONTAINS for fuzzy matching on names, roles, departments
7. WHERE clauses must come AFTER the entire MATCH pattern

HANDLING SPECIAL CASES:

1. COUNT QUERIES:
   - "How many employees/people/staff?" → Count ALL Person nodes
   - "How many developers?" → Count with role category filter
   - "How many in Engineering?" → Count with department filter

2. LIST QUERIES:
   - "Show all employees" → List ALL Person nodes (with LIMIT)
   - "List developers" → List with role category filter
   - "Find people in Sales" → List with department filter

3. HIERARCHICAL QUERIES:
   - "Who reports to X?" → Direct reports relationship
   - "X's manager" → Reports-to relationship
   - "Team leads" → Role-based search for Lead/Manager roles

4. NO RESULTS FALLBACK:
   - If a specific name/role might not exist, use broader CONTAINS
   - Consider both lowercase and title case variations
   - For roles, check multiple variations (e.g., "Dev" → "Developer", "Engineer")

COMMON PATTERNS WITH SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING:

EDGE CASE HANDLING:

1. Single word queries: "employees" → Treat as "list all employees"
2. Uppercase queries: Convert to proper case for matching
3. Typos: Use CONTAINS for partial matching
4. Ambiguous terms: Default to broader interpretation
5. No qualifier: "How many?" → Ask for clarification or default to Person count

Regional performance comparison:
- Question: "Compare ML inference performance across regions"
- Query: MATCH (m:Metric) WHERE m.service = 'ml-inference' AND m.type = 'response_time' AND m.percentile = 50 AND datetime(m.timestamp) >= datetime() - duration('P1D') WITH m.region as region, avg(m.value) as avg_response_time, min(m.value) as min_response_time, max(m.value) as max_response_time RETURN region, round(avg_response_time) as avg_ms, round(min_response_time) as min_ms, round(max_response_time) as max_ms ORDER BY avg_response_time

SLA achievement:
- Question: "Show current month SLA achievement for all services"
- Query: MATCH (m:Metric) WHERE m.type = 'sla_achievement' AND datetime(m.timestamp) >= datetime().truncate('month') RETURN m.service, m.region, m.value as sla_percentage ORDER BY m.service, m.region

Resource utilization patterns:
- Question: "Show CPU utilization for analytics services"
- Query: MATCH (m:Metric) WHERE m.type = 'cpu_utilization' AND m.service CONTAINS 'analytics' AND datetime(m.timestamp) >= datetime() - duration('P1D') WITH m.service as service, m.percentile as percentile, avg(m.value) as avg_cpu RETURN service, percentile, round(avg_cpu) as cpu_percentage ORDER BY service, percentile

Performance anomalies:
- Question: "Find performance anomalies in the last 24 hours"
- Query: MATCH (m1:Metric) WHERE m1.type = 'response_time' AND datetime(m1.timestamp) >= datetime() - duration('P1D') WITH m1.service as service, avg(m1.value) as baseline MATCH (m2:Metric) WHERE m2.service = service AND m2.type = 'response_time' AND datetime(m2.timestamp) >= datetime() - duration('P1D') AND m2.value > baseline * 3 RETURN m2.service, m2.region, m2.timestamp, m2.value as anomaly_value, round(baseline) as baseline_value, labels(m2) as labels ORDER BY m2.timestamp DESC
