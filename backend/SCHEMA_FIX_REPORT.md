# Schema Mismatch Fix Report

## Summary
Successfully fixed critical schema mismatch in Cypher query generation system. All prompt files have been updated with the correct FalkorDB schema.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated generate_query.txt
- Removed references to non-existent nodes (Project, Repository, PullRequest, Issue, Document, CalendarEvent)
- Fixed to use actual nodes: Person, Team, Group, Policy, Message
- Corrected relationship directions (Person-[:MEMBER_OF]->Team, not Team-[:MEMBER_OF]->Person)
- Added explicit instructions about WHERE clause placement
- Replaced regex operators (=~) with CONTAINS since FalkorDB doesn't support regex
- Added examples for common query patterns with correct syntax

### 2. Updated search_query.txt  
- Updated with correct node types and properties
- Fixed relationship patterns to match actual schema

### 3. Verified analyze_message.txt
- Already had correct schema, no changes needed

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Relationship Direction Corrections**:
   - Person-[:MEMBER_OF]->Team/Group (Person points TO Team/Group)
   - Person-[:REPORTS_TO]->Person (subordinate points TO manager)
   - Team/Group-[:RESPONSIBLE_FOR]->Policy

2. **Query Pattern Fixes**:
   - WHERE clauses must be placed after the entire pattern
   - Use CONTAINS instead of regex for text matching
   - Search by role property for titles (CTO, Manager) not name

3. **Case Sensitivity Handling**:
   - Added toLower() for policy categories
   - Use multiple CONTAINS checks for case variations

## Test Results

### Working Queries:
- ✅ "find people in engineering" - Returns 25 results
- ✅ "who are the managers in engineering?" - Returns managers correctly
- ✅ "who reports to the Chief Operating Officer?" - Query syntax correct
- ✅ Basic team membership and policy queries

### Improvements:
- Query generation now produces valid single-line Cypher statements
- Relationship directions are correct
- WHERE clause placement is proper
- Text matching works with FalkorDB's CONTAINS operator

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Fuzzy Matching**: FalkorDB doesn't support regex, so fuzzy matching is limited
2. **Case Sensitivity**: Need to handle with multiple CONTAINS or toLower()
3. **Model Behavior**: Ollama model sometimes needs very explicit instructions to avoid generating extra text

## Verification
The debug_query_tool.py successfully generates and executes queries with the updated schema. The system is now ready for full integration testing.
