# Query System Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-06-19

## Overview
Tested the query generation system with various natural language queries to validate the fixed schema and query generation capabilities.

## Test Results

### 1. "who are the team leads in engineering?"
**Generated Query:**
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(m:Person)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(t:Team WHERE t.name = 'Engineering') RETURN p.id, p.name, p.email, p.department, p.role, labels(p) as labels LIMIT 25
```
**Result:** ❌ Syntax Error - Invalid WHERE clause placement in node pattern
**Issue:** The query generator placed WHERE clause incorrectly within the node pattern

### 2. "find Sarah Chen's manager" 
**Generated Query:**
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Sarah Chen'})-[:REPORTS_TO]->(m:Person) RETURN m.id, m.name, m.email, m.department, m.role, labels(m) as labels
```
**Result:** ✅ Success - 0 results (Sarah Chen doesn't exist in test data)
**Note:** Query syntax is correct, tested with "Kenneth Chen" and got 1 result successfully

### 3. "who works on the mobile team?"
**Generated Query:**
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(t:Team) WHERE t.name = 'Mobile' RETURN p.id, p.name, p.email, p.department, p.role, labels(p) as labels LIMIT 25
```
**Result:** ✅ Success - 0 results (tested with "Mobile Apps" team name and got 14 results)
**Note:** Query structure is correct, just needed exact team name

### 4. "which teams are responsible for compliance policies?"
**Generated Query:**
```cypher
MATCH (t:Team)-[:RESPONSIBLE_FOR]->(p:Policy) WHERE toLower(p.category) = 'compliance' RETURN t.id, t.name, labels(t) as labels LIMIT 25
```
**Result:** ✅ Success - 0 results (no policies with 'compliance' category in test data)
**Note:** Query is correct. Test data has categories like 'security', 'development', 'data_privacy' but not 'compliance'

### 5. "show me people who report to the CTO"
**Generated Query:**
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person {name:'CTO'})-[:REPORTS_TO]->(r:Person) RETURN r.id, r.name, r.email, r.department, r.role, labels(r) as labels LIMIT 25
```
**Result:** ❌ Incorrect relationship direction
**Issue:** Query finds who CTO reports to, not who reports to CTO. Should be: `MATCH (p:Person)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(m:Person {role: 'CTO'})`

## Key Findings

### Working Query Patterns
1. **Simple node matching with properties** - Works well
2. **Single relationship traversal** - Works correctly
3. **WHERE clauses on node properties** - Functions properly
4. **Team membership queries** - Successful with correct team names

### Issues Identified
1. **WHERE clause placement in node patterns** - Generator sometimes places WHERE incorrectly in node syntax
2. **Relationship direction confusion** - "reports to" queries sometimes reverse the relationship direction
3. **Property name assumptions** - Generator assumes exact matches (e.g., "CTO" as name instead of role)

### Database Statistics
- **Person nodes**: 500 records with complete properties
- **Team nodes**: Multiple teams across departments (Engineering, Data Science, etc.)
- **Group nodes**: Cross-functional groups (Security Council, Incident Response Team, etc.)
- **Policy nodes**: Various policies with categories (security, development, data_privacy, operational)
- **MEMBER_OF relationships**: 579 connections
- **REPORTS_TO relationships**: 480 connections  
- **RESPONSIBLE_FOR relationships**: 26 connections

### Successful Alternative Queries
- "who are the managers in the engineering department?" - Returns 25 results
- "find Kenneth Chen's manager" - Returns Tamara Wright
- "who works on the Mobile Apps team?" - Returns 14 team members
- Teams/Groups responsible for security policies - Returns mix of Teams and Groups

## Recommendations
1. Update query generation prompts to handle WHERE clause placement correctly
2. Clarify relationship direction in prompts, especially for REPORTS_TO
3. Add fuzzy matching or role-based lookups instead of exact name matches
4. Consider adding fallback queries when exact matches fail
5. Improve natural language understanding for role titles vs. person names
