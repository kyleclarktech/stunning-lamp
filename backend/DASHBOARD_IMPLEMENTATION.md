# Dashboard Backend Implementation

## Overview

Phase 1 of the dashboard implementation has been completed. This includes all backend API endpoints, WebSocket broadcasting infrastructure, and comprehensive tests.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Dashboard API Endpoints (`/backend/api/dashboard.py`)

All six required endpoints have been implemented with Redis caching (60-second TTL):

- **GET /api/dashboard/overview** - Global metrics summary
  - Total counts for employees, teams, groups, policies, projects, offices, skills
  - Active incident count
  - System health status
  
- **GET /api/dashboard/offices** - Office status with on-call data
  - Office locations with employee counts
  - Online/offline status based on timezone
  - On-call staff information
  - Local time display

- **GET /api/dashboard/incidents** - Active incidents by severity
  - Incidents grouped by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
  - Assignee information
  - Timestamps and status tracking

- **GET /api/dashboard/metrics** - Performance metrics timeseries
  - 7-day historical data with hourly granularity
  - Metrics: query response time, active users, API requests, cache hit rate, error rate
  - Ready for Chart.js visualization

- **GET /api/dashboard/teams** - Team distribution data
  - Team sizes and department distribution
  - Top 10 skills across the organization
  - Average team size calculations

- **GET /api/dashboard/visas** - Visa expiry timeline
  - Categorized by expiry timeframe (30/90/180 days)
  - Summary statistics
  - Employee details for urgent cases

### 2. WebSocket Dashboard Broadcasting

Added WebSocket connection manager for real-time updates:

```python
# Broadcasting dashboard updates to all connected clients
await broadcast_dashboard_update("incidents", {"new_incident": incident_data})
await broadcast_dashboard_update("metrics", {"updated_metrics": metrics_data})
```

Features:
- Connection pooling for all WebSocket clients
- Automatic cleanup of disconnected clients
- Structured message format with timestamps
- Ready for frontend integration

### 3. Testing Infrastructure

- **Unit tests** (`/backend/tests/test_dashboard_api.py`)
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints
  - Mock data for isolated testing
  - Error and timeout handling tests
  - Cache behavior verification

- **Manual test script** (`/backend/test_dashboard_manual.py`)
  - Interactive testing of all endpoints
  - WebSocket connection testing
  - Pretty-printed results for debugging

## Technical Implementation Details

### Caching Strategy
- Redis integration with 60-second TTL for dashboard queries
- Fallback to direct queries if Redis unavailable
- Cache key pattern: `dashboard:{endpoint}:{query_type}`

### Query Optimization
- Async execution with ThreadPoolExecutor
- 15-second timeout for database queries
- Efficient aggregation queries using MATCH/WITH patterns

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 500, 504)
- Detailed error logging for debugging

## Dependencies Added

- `redis` - For caching dashboard data
- `pytest` - For running tests
- `pytest-asyncio` - For async test support

## Next Steps

The dashboard backend is ready for frontend integration. The next phases should focus on:

1. **Frontend Development** (Week 2)
   - Vue.js dashboard components
   - Leaflet map for office visualization
   - Chart.js for metrics display
   - WebSocket integration for real-time updates

2. **Import/Export System** (Week 3)
   - CSV/JSON bulk operations
   - Scheduled exports
   - Data validation

3. **API Gateway** (Week 4)
   - Rate limiting
   - API key management
   - Usage analytics

## Testing the Implementation

1. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Run manual tests:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python test_dashboard_manual.py
   ```

3. Run unit tests:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pytest tests/test_dashboard_api.py -v
   ```

4. Access endpoints directly:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/overview
   http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/offices
   http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/incidents
   http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/metrics
   http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/teams
   http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/visas
   ```
