# Semantic Query Framework Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive semantic query framework developed to address natural language query parsing issues in the FalkorDB chat interface. The framework solves the critical issue where queries like "How many employees are there?" were incorrectly searching for roles containing the word "employee" instead of counting all Person nodes.

## Problem Statement

### Original Issue
- **Query**: "How many employees are there?"
- **Generated Cypher**: `MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.role CONTAINS 'employee' OR p.role CONTAINS 'Employee' RETURN count(p) as count`
- **Result**: 0 employees (incorrect)
- **Root Cause**: The system was searching for roles containing "employee", but actual roles are specific titles like "Engineer", "Manager", etc.

### Solution
The semantic query framework understands that generic organizational terms like "employees", "staff", and "people" refer to ALL Person nodes in the database.

## Framework Components

### 1. Semantic Mapping System (`query_patterns_improved.py`)

The framework includes a comprehensive semantic mapping dictionary that translates generic terms into appropriate query patterns:

```python
SEMANTIC_MAPPINGS = {
    # Generic terms for all people
    "employees": {"type": "all_people"},
    "staff": {"type": "all_people"},
    "people": {"type": "all_people"},
    
    # Role categories  
    "developers": {"type": "role_category", "roles": ["Engineer", "Developer", "Architect"]},
    "managers": {"type": "role_category", "roles": ["Manager", "Lead", "Director", "VP"]},
    
    # Department categories
    "engineering team": {"type": "department_category", "departments": ["Engineering", "Data Platform"]}
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Query Pattern Matcher

The improved pattern matcher includes:

- **Semantic-aware patterns** that understand context
- **Priority-based matching** for better accuracy
- **Fallback mechanisms** for unmatched queries
- **Case-insensitive and whitespace-tolerant matching**

### 3. Query Generation Examples

#### Generic People Queries
- **Input**: "How many employees are there?"
- **Output**: `MATCH (p:Person) RETURN count(p) as count`

#### Role Category Queries
- **Input**: "List all developers"
- **Output**: `MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.role CONTAINS 'Engineer' OR p.role CONTAINS 'Developer' RETURN p.id, p.name, p.email, p.department, p.role, labels(p) as labels LIMIT 100`

#### Department + Role Queries
- **Input**: "Find engineers in Data Platform"
- **Output**: `MATCH (p:Person) WHERE (p.role CONTAINS 'Engineer') AND (p.department CONTAINS 'Data Platform') RETURN p.id, p.name, p.email, p.role, labels(p) as labels LIMIT 50`

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Update Pattern Matcher

Replace the import in `main.py`:

```python
# Old
from query_patterns import match_and_generate_query

# New
from query_patterns_improved import match_and_generate_query
```

### 2. Update Generate Query Prompt

Replace `prompts/generate_query.txt` with `prompts/generate_query_improved.txt` for better LLM-based query generation when patterns don't match.

### 3. Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_employee_query_fix.py
python test_semantic_queries.py
```

## Supported Query Types

### 1. Generic Organizational Queries
- How many employees/staff/people are there?
- Show me all employees/staff/workforce
- List everyone in the company

### 2. Role-Based Queries
- How many developers/engineers?
- Show me all managers/leaders
- Find executives/analysts/consultants

### 3. Department Queries
- People in Engineering/Sales/Product
- How many in Customer Success?
- Show the engineering team

### 4. Complex Queries
- Senior engineers in Infrastructure
- Team leads in Engineering
- Managers in the Data Platform department

### 5. Hierarchical Queries
- Who reports to Sarah?
- Who is Michael's manager?
- Show the org chart

### 6. Policy Queries
- Who owns the data retention policy?
- Find security policies
- Who's responsible for compliance?

## Performance Benefits

1. **Pattern Matching**: ~50% of queries handled by pre-compiled patterns (instant response)
2. **Semantic Understanding**: Reduces failed queries and improves accuracy
3. **Better UX**: Users get expected results for natural language queries

## Extensibility

### Adding New Semantic Mappings

```python
SEMANTIC_MAPPINGS["contractors"] = {
    "type": "role_category",
    "roles": ["Contractor", "Consultant", "Freelancer"]
}
```

### Adding New Query Patterns

```python
QueryPattern(
    name="new_pattern",
    description="Description",
    patterns=[r"regex pattern"],
    cypher_template="MATCH ...",
    parameter_extractors={"param": "1"},
    priority=10
)
```

## Error Handling

The framework includes:
- Fallback to LLM when no pattern matches
- Multiple variations for role/department matching
- Case-insensitive matching throughout
- Partial string matching with CONTAINS

## Monitoring and Debugging

Enable debug logging to see pattern matching:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning**: Train on successful queries to improve patterns
2. **Multi-language Support**: Add semantic mappings for other languages
3. **Context Awareness**: Consider previous queries in conversation
4. **Spell Correction**: Handle common typos automatically
5. **Query Optimization**: Analyze and optimize generated Cypher queries

## Conclusion

This semantic query framework provides a robust solution for natural language query understanding in the FalkorDB chat interface. It correctly handles generic organizational queries while maintaining support for specific, targeted searches. The framework is extensible and can be enhanced with additional semantic mappings as needed.
