### Key Findings

1. **qwen2.5-coder:7b is exceptionally fast**
   - 2.3x faster than phi4:14b
   - 2x faster than granite models
   - 100% syntax validity
   - Moderate VRAM usage (5.6GB)

2. **Coding-optimized models excel at Cypher**
   - qwen2.5-coder's specialized training shows clear benefits
   - Perfect syntax validity suggests deep understanding of query structure

3. **All models achieved high syntax validity (90-100%)**
   - Current simple prompting template is highly effective
   - No model produced invalid Cypher syntax consistently

## Sample Query Comparisons

### Query: "Find people with Python skills"

**qwen2.5-coder:7b** (1.50s):
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill)
WHERE toLower(s.name) = 'python'
RETURN p.name, p.email, p.department
```

**phi4:14b** (3.70s):
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill)
WHERE toLower(s.name) = 'python'
RETURN p.id AS PersonID, p.name AS Name, p.email AS Email, p.department AS Department, p.role AS Role, p.seniority AS Seniority, p.location AS Location
LIMIT 100
```

Note: qwen2.5-coder provides cleaner, more concise queries.

## Remaining Models Analysis

### Models We Didn't Test

**Priority 2 (Coding Models):**
- granite-code:8b - Another coding model, likely similar to qwen2.5-coder
- deepseek-coder:1.3b - Tiny model, fast but potentially less accurate
- codeqwen:7b - Variant of qwen, redundant given qwen2.5-coder results

**Priority 3 (General Models):**
- mistral:7b - Good general model but unlikely to beat qwen2.5-coder
- llama3.2:3b - Very small, worth testing for resource-constrained scenarios
- phi3-mini:3.8b - Compact alternative to phi4

### Should We Test More Models?

**Recommendation: No, proceed to Phase 2**

Reasons:
1. qwen2.5-coder shows coding-optimized models are superior
2. 2.3x speed improvement is significant enough to justify moving forward
3. 100% syntax validity leaves little room for improvement
4. Testing more general-purpose models unlikely to yield better results

**Exception:** Consider testing llama3.2:3b or deepseek-coder:1.3b only if:
- VRAM constraints require <4GB models
- Edge deployment needs ultra-fast response times
- You need a backup option under 2GB

## Updated Recommendations for Phase 2

### Top 3 Models for Phase 2 Testing

1. **qwen2.5-coder:7b** (PRIMARY)
   - Fastest response time (1.67s)
   - Perfect syntax validity
   - Coding-optimized for query generation

2. **granite3.3:8b-largectx** (ALTERNATIVE)
   - Good balance of speed and resources
   - 100% syntax validity
   - Larger context window for complex queries

3. **phi4:14b** (BASELINE)
   - Current production model
   - Most sophisticated outputs
   - Benchmark for comparison

### Why Skip Other Models

- **granite-code:8b**: Redundant with qwen2.5-coder success
- **mistral:7b**: General model won't beat coding-specific
- **Small models (1-3B)**: Only if specific constraints require

## Conclusion

Phase 1 testing revealed that **qwen2.5-coder:7b** is the optimal model for Cypher query generation, with:
- 2.3x faster performance than current production (phi4:14b)
- Perfect syntax validity
- Reasonable resource usage

**Recommended Action:** Proceed immediately to Phase 2 with these three models to optimize prompting strategies. The performance gap is large enough that further model testing would provide diminishing returns.
