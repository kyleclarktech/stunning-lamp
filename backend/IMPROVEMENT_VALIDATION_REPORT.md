## Improvement Analysis

### Most Effective Improvements

| Improvement Type | Queries Fixed | Impact |
|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Validation Caught | 7 | 77.8% |
| Post Processing | 2 | 22.2% |

### Example Improvements

#### Example 1: mistral:7b
**Query**: "List all teams in the engineering department"

**Original**: `MATCH (n:Node {name:'Maintenance'})-[:REQUIRES]->(s:Service)
WHERE s.status = 'critical' OR s.status...`

**Fixes Applied**: General processing

#### Example 2: mistral:7b
**Query**: "Find all critical security policies updated this year"

**Original**: `MATCH (n:Node {name:'Maintenance'})-[:REQUIRES]->(s:Service)
WHERE s.status = 'critical'
RETURN n.id...`

**Fixes Applied**: General processing

#### Example 3: mistral:7b
**Query**: "How many people work in each department?"

**Original**: `MATCH (n:Node {name:'Server'})-[:CONNECTED_TO]->(m:Node) WHERE n.status = 'critical' AND m.status = ...`

**Fixes Applied**: General processing


## Recommendations

1. [WARNING] **Additional improvements needed** to reach 85-90% target.
2. Current improvements show positive impact but more work is required.
3. Consider installing and testing the missing models for complete validation.

## Next Steps

1. Install missing models to complete the full 9-model test suite
2. Focus on query categories with lowest success rates
3. Enhance fallback strategies for complex queries
4. Consider model-specific prompt optimizations
