# Comprehensive Model Failure Theme Analysis

## Executive Summary

After analyzing 107 error occurrences across 9 models and 27 test queries, clear failure patterns have emerged. The failures are primarily due to FalkorDB-specific syntax requirements and models being trained on Neo4j or generic Cypher syntax.

## Top 5 Failure Themes

### 1. **Function Name Mismatches (19 occurrences - 18% of failures)**
Models consistently use incorrect function names for FalkorDB:
- ❌ `lower()` or `LOWER()` → ✅ `toLower()`
- ❌ `date()` → ✅ Not supported (need workaround)
- ❌ `year()` → ✅ Not supported (need workaround)
- ❌ `datetime()` → ✅ Not supported (need workaround)

**Root Cause**: Models trained on Neo4j datasets where these functions exist.

### 2. **Multi-Statement Query Errors (11 occurrences - 10% of failures)**
Models generate queries with multiple statements separated by semicolons:
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p; -- Comment
MATCH (t:Team) RETURN t;
```

**Root Cause**: Models trying to be helpful by adding comments or alternative queries.

### 3. **ShortestPath Placement Issues (11 occurrences - 10% of failures)**
FalkorDB requires `shortestPath` only in WITH or RETURN clauses:
```cypher
❌ MATCH path = shortestPath((a)-[*]-(b)) WHERE ...
✅ MATCH (a), (b) WHERE ... WITH shortestPath((a)-[*]-(b)) AS path
```

**Root Cause**: FalkorDB-specific constraint not present in Neo4j.

### 4. **Filtered Alias Resolution (9 occurrences - 8% of failures)**
Complex filtering patterns fail to resolve:
```cypher
❌ WHERE NOT EXISTS ((t:Team)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(p:Person))
❌ WHERE size([(p:Person)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(t)]) > 10
```

**Root Cause**: FalkorDB has stricter alias resolution than Neo4j.

### 5. **Aggregation Function Misuse (Multiple occurrences)**
Using aggregation functions incorrectly:
```cypher
❌ WHERE count(p) > 10
✅ WITH t, COUNT(p) as member_count WHERE member_count > 10
```

**Root Cause**: Standard Cypher mistake, but FalkorDB is less forgiving.

## Additional Patterns

### SQL/Cypher Confusion
Some models (especially codeqwen:7b) occasionally generate SQL:
```sql
SELECT p.name FROM Person p WHERE ...
```

### Variable Scope Issues
Using variables before they're defined or outside their scope:
```cypher
❌ WITH p WHERE q.name = 'X' // 'q' not defined
```

### Query Timeout Issues
Complex pattern matching causing 1-second timeouts, especially circular patterns.

## Model-Specific Observations

**Best at avoiding errors:**
- granite3.3:8b-largectx (70.4% success)
- granite3.3:8b (66.7% success)
- phi4:14b (63.0% success)

**Most problematic:**
- deepseek-coder:1.3b (often returns explanations instead of queries)
- granite-code:8b (35.2% success)

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. **Prompt Engineering**
Add FalkorDB-specific rules to prompts:
```
IMPORTANT FalkorDB Rules:
- Use toLower() not lower() or LOWER()
- Date functions are not supported
- shortestPath must be in WITH or RETURN only
- Return single statements only, no semicolons except at end
- Use WITH for aggregations before filtering
```

### 2. **Function Mapping Layer**
Create a post-processing layer to fix common function issues:
```python
query = query.replace("lower(", "toLower(")
query = query.replace("LOWER(", "toLower(")
```

### 3. **Query Validation**
Pre-execution validation to catch:
- Multiple semicolons
- Undefined variables
- Aggregation functions in WHERE

### 4. **Model Fine-tuning**
Consider fine-tuning on FalkorDB-specific examples to reduce these errors.

### 5. **Fallback Strategies**
Implement query simplification when complex queries fail:
- Remove shortestPath and use regular paths
- Simplify aggregations
- Break complex patterns into simpler queries

## Impact on Production

Current best model (granite3.3:8b-largectx) still has 30% failure rate. To achieve production readiness:
1. Implement the function mapping layer (could reduce errors by ~20%)
2. Add query validation (could catch ~10% more errors)
3. Use fallback strategies for complex queries
4. Consider a query rewriting service for failed queries

## Conclusion

The majority of failures are due to:
1. **Training data mismatch** - Models trained on Neo4j, not FalkorDB
2. **Syntax strictness** - FalkorDB is less forgiving than Neo4j
3. **Missing functions** - Date/time functions need workarounds
4. **Complexity handling** - Models struggle with complex patterns

With proper error handling and query preprocessing, we could potentially achieve 85-90% success rates with the best models.
