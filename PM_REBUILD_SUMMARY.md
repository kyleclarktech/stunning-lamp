# Agentic PM Assistant - Complete Rebuild Plan

## Executive Summary

I've updated the rebuild plan to focus on the **original core purpose**: an **Agentic PM Assistant** for teams without dedicated human project managers. This system goes beyond simple organizational queries to provide autonomous project management capabilities including task breakdown, intelligent assignment, and progress tracking.

## Core PM Capabilities

### 1. **Project Planning & Breakdown**
- Natural language project initiation ("Build a customer dashboard with Stripe integration")
- Automatic decomposition into phases and tasks
- Dependency mapping and timeline estimation
- Risk identification and mitigation planning

### 2. **Intelligent Task Assignment**
- Multi-factor skill matching algorithm
- Real-time bandwidth tracking and workload balancing
- Growth opportunity consideration
- Alternative assignment suggestions

### 3. **Progress Monitoring**
- Bottleneck detection and resolution
- Velocity tracking and forecasting
- Automated status updates
- Proactive risk alerts

### 4. **Team Optimization**
- Workload balancing strategies
- Cross-training recommendations
- Burnout prevention
- Knowledge distribution

## Updated Architecture

### New PM-Specific Modules

1. **@project-planner** - Breaks down projects into actionable tasks
2. **@task-manager** - Manages task lifecycle and dependencies
3. **@skill-matcher** - Matches tasks with team members
4. **@bandwidth-tracker** - Tracks availability and workload
5. **@progress-monitor** - Monitors progress and identifies issues
6. **@assignment-engine** - Optimizes task assignments

### Enhanced Data Model

```typescript
// Core PM Entities
- Project (scope, timeline, stakeholders)
- Task (requirements, dependencies, effort)
- Assignment (person, confidence, alternatives)
- SkillProfile (proficiency, experience, goals)
- BandwidthRecord (availability, commitments)
```

## Key Innovations

### 1. **Skill Matching Algorithm**
```typescript
Score = 40% skill_match + 20% experience + 20% availability + 10% growth + 10% balance
```

### 2. **Task Decomposition Patterns**
- Functional area breakdown
- Complexity-based recursion
- Template-driven generation
- Cross-cutting concern injection

### 3. **Workload Optimization**
- Multiple balancing strategies (time, knowledge, growth, risk)
- Constraint satisfaction solver
- Real-time adjustment capabilities

## Natural Language PM Interface

### Example Interactions

**Project Initiation**:
```
User: "We need to build a customer dashboard that shows usage metrics, 
       billing info, and support tickets. Should integrate with Stripe 
       and Zendesk. Timeline is 6 weeks."

System: "I'll break this down into a project plan. Based on the requirements,
         I've identified 4 main phases with 23 tasks..."
```

**Task Assignment**:
```
User: "Who should work on the payment integration?"

System: "Best Match: David Chen
         - Has Stripe API experience (3 projects)
         - Available 20 hours next week
         - Confidence: 92%"
```

**Progress Monitoring**:
```
User: "Show me the current bottlenecks"

System: "I've identified 3 bottlenecks:
         1. Database Migration - blocking 5 tasks
         2. API Documentation - blocking frontend
         3. Code Review Backlog - 8 PRs waiting"
```

## Implementation Changes

### Phase 3 Focus: PM Intelligence (Weeks 5-6)
- **Week 5**: Project analyzer, task decomposer, skill ontology
- **Week 6**: Assignment engine, bandwidth tracker, workload optimizer

### New Test Scenarios
- Project planning accuracy
- Assignment satisfaction rates
- Workload balance metrics
- Bottleneck detection speed

### Success Metrics
- Assignment satisfaction: > 90%
- Estimation accuracy: Â± 20%
- Workload variance: < 20%
- Planning time saved: > 80%

## Files Created/Updated

1. **REBUILD_PRD.md** - Updated with PM focus and new modules
2. **PM_CAPABILITIES_SPEC.md** - Detailed PM algorithms and workflows
3. **PM_TOUCHPOINTS_PATTERNS.md** - PM-specific patterns and navigation
4. **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** - Updated phases for PM functionality

## Key Differentiators

### vs. Traditional PM Tools
- **Natural language** interface vs forms/fields
- **Intelligent assignment** vs manual allocation
- **Proactive monitoring** vs reactive reporting
- **Learning system** vs static rules

### vs. Simple Task Trackers
- **Automatic breakdown** vs manual task creation
- **Skill-based matching** vs name-based assignment
- **Workload awareness** vs simple lists
- **Dependency management** vs isolated tasks

## Next Steps

1. **Review PM algorithms** with your team
2. **Define skill ontology** for your domain
3. **Set up test scenarios** with real project data
4. **Choose integration points** (Jira, GitHub, Slack, etc.)

The system now truly serves as an **autonomous PM assistant**, handling the complex work of project planning, resource allocation, and progress tracking that teams without dedicated PMs struggle with. This addresses the original vision while maintaining all the architectural benefits of the modular, AI-agent friendly design.
