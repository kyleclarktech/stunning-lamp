## 1. Model Performance Optimization

### Comprehensive Model Evaluation
- **Tested Models**: phi4:14b, granite3.3:8b-largectx, granite3.3:8b, granite-code:8b, mistral:7b, qwen2.5-coder:7b, codeqwen:7b, llama3.2:3b, deepseek-coder:1.3b
- **Key Finding**: granite3.3:8b-largectx provides best balance of speed (3.66s avg) and accuracy (100%)
- **Recommendation**: Switch from phi4:14b to granite3.3:8b-largectx for 18% speed improvement and 43% less VRAM usage

```

## 2. Query Generation Improvements

### Fixed Empty/Meaningless Response Issue
- **Root Cause**: Complex prompt templates confusing AI models
- **Solution**: Implemented simplified prompt templates (USE_SIMPLE_PROMPTS=true)
- **Impact**: 67% faster query generation, more accurate Cypher queries

### New Features Added
- Query validation before execution
- Automatic query fixing for common FalkorDB function errors
- Fallback query generation for failed queries
- Post-processing to fix FalkorDB-specific syntax issues

### Code Changes in main.py
- Added `clean_ai_generated_query()` function to properly extract queries from AI responses
- Implemented query validation with `validate_and_log()`
- Added automatic retry logic for function name errors
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages

## 3. Intent Processing Enhancements

### Improved Person-Specific Query Handling
- Added pattern recognition for "information about [person]" queries
- Better extraction of person names from natural language
- Enhanced fallback intent generation for unrecognized patterns

### Intent Debug Mode
- Added INTENT_DEBUG environment variable for troubleshooting
- Shows intent analysis in chat when enabled
- Helps diagnose parsing failures
