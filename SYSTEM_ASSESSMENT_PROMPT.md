# Graph Database System Assessment for Global SaaS Data Analytics Company

## Comprehensive System Review Request

Conduct a thorough evaluation of the graph database and query generation system to validate its capability to support project and task management for a global SaaS data analytics company with headquarters in the US and offices in UK, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia. The assessment should cover:

### 1. Query Coverage Analysis
Verify the system can handle these critical query categories:

**Resource Management Queries:**
- Find available resources with specific skill combinations and proficiency levels across all time zones
- Identify over/under-utilized team members considering local holidays and working hours
- Match people to projects based on skills, availability, seniority, and time zone overlap
- Calculate resource costs considering local currency and regional billing rates
- Identify single points of failure and coverage gaps across geographic regions
- Support 24/7 customer operations with follow-the-sun staffing models

**Project Planning Queries:**
- Assess project feasibility based on skill requirements vs availability across regions
- Track project dependencies and cross-team coordination needs across time zones
- Monitor sprint velocity and project health metrics by regional teams
- Identify bottlenecks in global project delivery pipelines
- Forecast completion dates considering regional holidays and time differences
- Coordinate multi-region product launches and data platform deployments
- Plan customer implementations across APAC, EMEA, and Americas regions

**Capacity Planning Queries:**
- Analyze team capacity trends and utilization patterns per region
- Predict future capacity needs based on regional market growth and customer demand
- Identify skills that need hiring or development in specific locations
- Balance workload across teams considering 24/7 SaaS operations requirements
- Plan for regional holidays (Golden Week, Christmas, Bastille Day, etc.)
- Optimize data engineering coverage for platform reliability across time zones
- Scale customer success and professional services teams by region

**Knowledge Management Queries:**
- Find subject matter experts for data platform technologies across all offices
- Track knowledge transfer effectiveness across language and cultural barriers
- Identify critical knowledge at risk in specific regions (visa dependencies, local expertise)
- Map global expertise networks for cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Plan succession strategies considering immigration and relocation constraints
- Document regional compliance expertise (GDPR, CCPA, APAC privacy laws)
- Maintain 24/7 incident response expertise across time zones

**Performance & Analytics Queries:**
- Compare planned vs actual project allocations across regions
- Analyze skill development progression considering local market demands
- Track team velocity normalized for regional holidays and working patterns
- Identify high-performing cross-regional team compositions
- Measure customer satisfaction and platform performance by region
- Analyze data pipeline reliability metrics across geographic deployments
- Track SaaS platform adoption and usage patterns by market

### 2. Data Model Completeness
Evaluate whether the current schema adequately captures:

**Missing Entities:**
- Regional Office (location, timezone, holidays, regulations)
- Customer Account (region, tier, MRR, data volume, platform usage)
- Data Center/Cloud Region (for platform deployment planning)
- Language Proficiency (for global customer support)
- Compliance Requirement (by jurisdiction)
- On-call Schedule (for 24/7 operations)
- Platform Component (for expertise mapping)

**Missing Relationships:**
- (Person)-[:SPEAKS]->(Language) with proficiency level
- (Team)-[:SUPPORTS_REGION]->(Region) for customer coverage
- (Project)-[:DEPLOYED_IN]->(CloudRegion) for platform features
- (Person)-[:ON_CALL_FOR]->(PlatformComponent) with schedule
- (Customer)-[:USES_FEATURE]->(PlatformFeature) for usage analytics
- (Office)-[:FOLLOWS_REGULATIONS]->(ComplianceFramework)
- (Person)-[:WORKED_IN]->(Office) for collaboration history

**Missing Attributes:**
- Person: visa_status, work_authorization_countries, language_skills
- Team: primary_region, secondary_regions, customer_facing
- Project: target_regions, compliance_requirements, data_residency_needs
- Office: local_holidays, business_hours, regulatory_jurisdiction
- Skill: regional_demand, certification_requirements_by_country
- Client: data_residency_requirements, support_tier, time_zone_preferences

### 3. Query Generation Capabilities
Test the system's ability to:

**Handle Complex Queries:**
- Multi-hop traversals (find people who work with people who have skill X)
- Temporal queries (availability over specific date ranges)
- Aggregation across multiple relationship types
- Conditional logic and fallback strategies
- Optimization hints for large datasets

**Support Natural Language Variations:**
- "Who can provide Japanese language support for our Tokyo customers?"
- "Find GDPR experts who can work with our Frankfurt team"
- "Build a follow-the-sun support team for our data platform"
- "What's our AWS expertise coverage across APAC offices?"
- "Show me engineers who can legally work in both US and UK"
- "Which teams can handle a customer implementation in Singapore?"
- "Find Python experts in UTC+8 to UTC+10 time zones"
- "Who can lead platform reliability during US night hours?"

### 4. Scalability Assessment
Verify performance with:
- 10,000+ employees across 7 global offices
- 1,000+ enterprise SaaS customers
- 100+ concurrent projects across regions
- 24/7 platform operations data
- Multi-region data residency requirements
- Complex queries spanning time zones and regulations
- Real-time platform monitoring and incident data

### 5. Integration Readiness
Evaluate support for:
- Multi-region HR systems (Workday, BambooHR)
- Global calendar systems with holiday management
- Customer data platforms (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Platform monitoring tools (Datadog, New Relic)
- Cloud billing and usage APIs (AWS, GCP, Azure)
